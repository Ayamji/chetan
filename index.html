                    <p>We never really talked.
                        Not properly.
                        Not the way I wanted to.

                        Just a few conversations —
                        small, ordinary, forgettable to the world.

                        But I remember them.

                        You were always this quiet light in a noisy classroom.
                        Unaware that someone, somewhere in the same room,
                        was hoping for just one more sentence from you.

                        You were different.
                        Not loud. Not trying to impress anyone.
                        Just… pure.

                        And maybe that’s why I noticed you..</p>

                    <h2>When Silence Found a Voice</h2>
                    <p>It started with simple calls.

                        Then they became longer.
                        And longer.

                        We talked about everything.
                        And sometimes, about nothing at all.

                        But even silence felt full.

                        Your voice —
                        it wasn’t just sound anymore.

                        It was comfort.
                        It was home.

                        I didn’t check the time anymore.
                        Because when I was with you,
                        time didn’t matter.

                        Somewhere along the way,
                        you stopped being just someone I liked.

                        You became part of my everyday.</p>

                        Or soft words.
                        Or perfect moments.

                        It’s staying.

                        Through moods.
                        Through misunderstandings.
                        Through days that aren’t easy.

                        And that’s what I promise you.

                        No matter how loud the world gets,
                        no matter how complicated life becomes,
                        I will be there.

                        Not sometimes.
                        Not when it’s convenient.

                        Always.

                        Because I don’t just love you in moments.

                        I love you in permanence.</p>
